## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating something using all the knowledge we have gained from learning JavaScript, and the "tool" we selected to assist in the creation of our project. The purpose of this blog is to document the process of creating my own Freedom Project.

## Content
For my project, I am making a student report creation tool. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) in order to make my personal tool, which would assist me in writing reports for students that I teach as a Taekwondo instructor. Writing weekly reports helps me to know where my students are at, what they need to improve, and how I can get them there.

## Implications
I feel that for the most part, this project will have mostly postitive impacts in our world. It is a student reporter that is meant to help teachers better help their students after all. Although particularly personnalized towards my needs, this project could easily become something any teacher can use if they'd like. 

In terms of the positive impacts this will have, I feel that it will help teachers better maintain records and understanding of their students. Writing about students and how they are progressing, can help them come to conclusions about how they can better teach their students. In general, I feel this tool could make the lives of many teachers who would like to track the progress of students much easier. It doesn't even have to apply to just students, it can be a team of athletes, or a patient recovering from an injury. It can even be used to personally track something.Overall, I feel that this is just an overwhelmingly positive tool for so many types of people to use. 

Of course, there are likely some negatives of this tool. I feel like the biggest issue may be how comfortable people would be with the fact that someone else is writing things about them, especially if they might not know. Although it is necessary to be able to know where a student or athlete is and how they are doing, they still may not be comfortable with that data being online to begin with. 

In general, I feel like nonethless my project could have a positive impact on society, especially since it would help improve the experience of people like my own Taekwondo students.
