# Entry 1: __Schedueles, Firebase, and Taekwondo__
##### 11/8/21

### Context:

So, my project idea is basically this:
A scheduling app for me, as Taekwondo Jr. Instructor, to plan out my classes and see all the upcoming events, which would help me decide what I would teach, and all the reminders and notes I use when I am planning/looking at my notes as I teach. This is a really complex idea as I start to break it down, I have quite a bit of planning done in my notes. That will all unfold as the blog entries go on because, in this entry, I am going to talk about the tool that I will use in order to create my project. And my project is going to be Firebase, which is basically for creating mobile/web applications. It also provides use of a real-time database, authentication services, Firestore cloud storage, etc ([Firebase Products](https://firebase.google.com/products-build)). For my idea, [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore), for example, would be really useful for storing files which would contain notes on everything I need to know about my teaching my classes. [Firebase Realtime Databases](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database) would also be a useful feature for my program, since I like to edit my schedule on my computer, but look at it later while I’m teaching, on my phone. In general, Firebase would be extremely useful for managing notes and data on my project, between devices. 

One other tool I had in mind when I was researching tools was Google’s [Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api). I feel that this would have been a very useful tool for helping to plan out my calendar for events, but it wouldn’t really help with the included scale of the other important features I want my app to have. I did not have many other tools in mind, (my schedule makes it really difficult to focus on the FP and as a result, I only make significant progress when actually made to do it.)

### EDP:

Currently, I’d say that I’m actually at the both the Research The Problem  and Create A Prototype stage, because I actually have a lot of the project planned out. I know what I want my application to look like, I know the basic features I want it to have, but I don’t know exactly how to do it yet, which is where Research The Problem comes in. Once I learn how to do everything I need for my project (which would involve completely learning Firebase and learning even more Javascript) then I will be able to actually create a working prototype!

### Skills:

I practiced a lot of How to learn  skills by researching Firebase, and having to test it out. In order create my project, I’m going to need to learn Firebase on my own. So far, I have learned a bit about how to use Firebase in order to create a project and how Firebase services, along with projects, are imported into a project. In order to do this though, I needed to practice How to read, which is how to read the documentation for Firebase. This was a little bit difficult as I didn’t completely understand everything there is to know about Firebase, so I had to slowly work through it and just keep on reading and attempting to comprehend everything. 

### Conclusion:

At this point, I’d say I’m in a pretty good place for my project. I already know what exactly I want, and I’m pretty sure I know all the things i need. Now, I just need to keep on learning JS and Firebase, and once it’s time to prototype, I should be ready to create part or even all of the project.
